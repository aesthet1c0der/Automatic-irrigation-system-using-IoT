# IoT-project-
Required components : NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontroller, MQ135 pollution sensor, LM393 soil moisture sensor, DHT11 humidity sensor.
Before starting project : install arduino IDE , create account in 000webhost (hosting website).
step 1: connect all the components in the breadboard as per the circuit diagram.
step 2: download the arduino and website files from this repository. 
step 3: open arduino file in the arduino IDE and fill your network SSID and PASS in the line mentioned.
step 4: Sign in to 000webhost to create a website, database and upload the website files in the 000webhost file manager.
step 5: change the database name and password in the php files.
step 6: fill the website file manager URL in the arduino code where it is mentioned.
step 5: connect the ESP8266 (which is connected in the breadboard with all the sensors) to the laptop or computer. 
step 6: select the port number and board in the arduino software.
step 8: upload the code in the ESP8266.
step 9: you can now see the sensor values updated in the serial monitor and website.
